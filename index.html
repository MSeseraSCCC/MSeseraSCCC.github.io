		<h2>Taking French in high school</h2>
		<p>Taking a foreign language is required in most high school settings. This requirement tends to be only one year, but many colleges look for several years of a language.
			Taking French as a language may seem strange, as many people believe Spanish to be a more widely used language and are used to it from elementary and middle school. However, French is
			very similar to learn, being a romance language like Spanish, and it is more widely spoken than Spanish. Spanish is more prevalent in the United States, but even in neighboring countries, such as Canada, French is an official language.
			Therefore, I urge students entering high school or those who have yet to take a language to consider French. I enjoyed my time learning it, and I had many <a href="mytrip.html">unique cultural experiences</a> that others would have missed.
		</p>
		
		<h2>French around the world</h2>
		<p>French is widely spoken around the world, which may come as a surprise to some United States citizens. World history classes tend to fail to mention conquests throughout time, which lead to many nations speaking French.
			French is widely spoken across Africa and large parts of Europe, not just in France. For example, French is one of Switzerland's <b>FOUR</b> national languages. In addition to all of these European and African nations,
			French is also spoken in some parts of Canada, although it is mostly spoken in Quebec.
		</p>
		
		<h2>The Transition</h2>
		<p>Perhaps you were like me, being forced to take years of Spanish throughout elementary and middle school because it was the only language available, and you couldn't wait to get out of it; that makes the transition seem easy and enjoyable.
			However, not everyone felt that way. If you are someone who enjoyed Spanish and are maybe looking to expand your horizons, French is similar to Spanish in many ways, because they are both romance languages, but it is different enough to
			feel as though it is another language and not just different dialects. French is absolutely worth learning, and high school is a great time to learn it.
