		<h2>The beginning</h2>
		<p>In my third year of taking French in high school, the opportunity to take a trip to France as an exchange student presented itself.
			I saw this as an opportunity to immerse myself in the culture and the language, so I decided to go on this trip. The plan was to fly into Paris,
			and then take a train down to Toulouse where we would meet our host families. My host brother was a kid a year or two younger than me named Quentin.
			As soon as we met up, we drove home, and I crashed hard from the long flight and the short tour around Paris.

		<h2>The stay in Toulouse</h2>
		<p>In Toulouse, some days we shadowed our host siblings through their day at school. It was interesting to see the differences between American schools and
			French schools. Other days, we would explore the town. We saw some churches, the local government building, and even a nearby castle named Carcassone.
			Carcassone was a sprawling castle that sat near the border between France and Spain, and it was everything expected of a medieval castle: sets of large walls,
			towers and turrets, a large portcullis, and a fortified keep. It was quite interesting to be able to walk through history like that. Towards the end of our stay with
			our host siblings, we celebrated Easter. The French tradition of Easter is quite different from my own, as my host family had a large dinner that consisted of slow cooked
			rabbit (which was <i>delicious</i>). My family is used to a large Ukranian breakfast with cheese babka and large amounts of eggs and kielbasa (a type of Eastern European sausage).

		<h2>Onwards towards Paris</h2>
		<p>The goodbyes were hard as we left Toulouse. Even in the few days we had to be together, many of us grew quite close to our host siblings. The train ride back to Paris was
			a long, solitary one. After we arrived back in Paris, we took our luggage to the hotel where we would be staying for the remainder of our trip. Afterwards, we took a <b>long</b> bus tour around Paris,
			eventually coming to a tour of Versailles. In the next couple days, we visited both the Louvre and the Musee d'Orsay, as well as the Eiffel Tower, some large shopping malls, and even the crypts below the city.
			There were also tours of the city at night on the river, as well as a long, arduous climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe.

		<h2>May we meet again someday</h2>
		<p>Though we were all having such a great time, we had to get back to the regular schedule of our school year. After all the fun of our trip to France and the visits with our host Families, we loaded up our luggage and got on the plane back to the US.
			We had class the next day, and we weren't allowed to miss it. And so, the school year proceeded as normal, but all of us on that trip got quite a bit more than just education out of our willingness to learn French.  If I had the opportunity to do it again, I would take it immediately.
