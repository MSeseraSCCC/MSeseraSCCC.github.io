		<h2>Hello!</h2>
		<p>To say hello in French, use "bonjour" for during the morning and the day, and use "bonsoir" during the evening.</p>
		
		<h2>Goodbye.</h2>
		<p>To say goodbye, use "au revoir" regardless of the time of day. This is pronounced "arr vwah"</p>
		
		<h2>Now on to Hello! My name is _______"</h2>
		<p>You already know how to say hello, now follow up with "je m'appelle __________" which sounds just like it looks. Simple, right?</p>
		
		<h2>Hello?</h2>
		<p>Speaking on the phone is a little bit different in French than in English. Instead of saying bonjour to answer the phone, you say "All√¥?" This essentially translates to "Hello?" as well as bonjour, but it is used specifically for phone calls.</p>
		
		<h2>Yes/No</h2>
		<p>To say yes, you want to use "oui" (pronounced "we"), and to san no, use "non" which sounds similar to a combination between "no" and a nasally "nah" in English.
		
		<h2>Your turn!</h2>
		<p>I can't possibly hope to teach you my years of French with a single website, but this was just a taste of the language. If you think you might enjoy learning French, look around you.
			You may find a course at your local high school or community college. In addition, there are many free resources that you can find on the internet with a quick search. Try it out!
